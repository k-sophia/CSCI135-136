/**********
Assignment: Lab7-B

Write a new program, indent.cpp, that can fix
indentation in C/C++ source code files.

Write a function:
-   int countChar(string line, char c);

As it reads the input line by line, it should also
- count the number of open and closed { } in it
- keep track of how many blocks is currently open at
    the beginning of each line

Shortcomings of our program:
- No support for loops and if statements that donâ€™t have curly braces
- Symbols {, } inside string and char literals are misinterpreted as blocks

    string fix = line;
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if(!(isspace(fix[i]))) { //loop till get non space
            break;
        }
    }

    return fix.substr(i, len); //return first non space character onward
}

        code = removeLeadingSpaces(code); //get code with leading spaces removed

        indent -= countChar(code, '}'); //remove indent
        for (int i = 0; i < indent; i++) { //print tabs
            cout << "\t";
        }

        cout << code << endl; //print fix code
        indent += countChar(code, '{'); //add indent
